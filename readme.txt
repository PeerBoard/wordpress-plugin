### PeerBoard Use Cases:

**1. Professional Communities**
A community is a great way to encourage social collaboration among employees or members of an organization. PeerBoard lets your employees have coherent and meaningful conversations within a private community.

- **Collaborate**: Let employees across departments, locations or time zones have meaningful discussions without creating constant distractions.
- **Share Knowledge**: Foster the kind of valuable networks and strong connections between your members that keep them coming back.
- **Privacy Controls**: Keep your community private and control access and permissions. Integrate to your access control system.

**2. Private Social Networks**
Tired of using traditional social media tools to connect with users and fans? Build your own social networking platform on your own website with PeerBoard.

- **Break away from Facebook groups and Reddit forums**: Building your own private social network allows you to deliver user-friendly content in a way that makes sense for your organization. Create an ad-free experience where your content doesn’t compete with other brands in user feeds and emails and where you have the flexibility to integrate with external services. Spend less time formatting posts for social media sites and more time building up your own online community.
- **Control your own data**: Big social networking sites require phone numbers, emails, and other personal information at signup. But marketers and advertisers working on the platform don’t get to see any of that. Users also may not want to share it in the first place. Whether you’re building a community forum or trying to control your brand, building a private social network allows you to determine what data you collect, why it matters, and who you share it with.
- **Perfect for every niche**: Social media platforms are great at connecting users, but they’re a standardized solution meant to fill every niche. With PeerBoard, you can customize the look, style, and scale of your forum so that messaging is clear and precise — without off-brand advertisement and algorithms getting in the way of a great user experience.

**3. Product Communities**
Gather community insights that improve functionality and interest for your products and services.

- **Get critical feedback during product development**: Customer feedback is a critical element of product development. Project stakeholders use it to gauge interest. Team members use it to add features, tweak designs, and determine how to talk about products with customers. Your product forum can serve as a communication platform to help you gain knowledge and improve your products.
- **Crowdsource ideas and create customer advocates**: Customers are more likely to engage with your products when they help build them. Using PeerBoard, you can crowdsource ideas, solicit feedback, answer questions, and more. By adding customer feedback to your product development roadmaps and incorporating valuable ideas into your building a more complete solution that your general audience can use.
- **Improve your knowledge base**: Whether your product is about to launch or has been on the shelf for years, you can always improve usability through support and knowledge. A community platform can serve as a support tool, allowing users to troubleshoot issues, consult support documentation, create user-generated guides and tutorials, and work together to solve their own problems.
